# NeuroVision: Forecasting Health on the Spectrum 

This repository contains machine learning models and techniques for predicting Autism, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, Covid-19 infections, Diabetes, Lung Cancer and Anemia. The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and data science to provide insights into these medical conditions, aiding in early diagnosis and better healthcare management.

### About the Project:
The project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant datasets and develop predictive models for each condition. By training on diverse datasets and employing advanced techniques, we aim to achieve accurate predictions that can assist healthcare professionals in decision-making and patient care.

### Datasets:
We have sourced publicly available datasets on Kaggle for each medical condition:

- **Autism**: The Autism Screening Adult Data includes demographic and behavioral features for individuals to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
- **Parkinson's Disease**: The Parkinson's Telemonitoring Data provides voice recordings and clinical measurements for predicting the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms.
- **Stroke**: The Stroke Prediction Dataset contains medical records and lifestyle information to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence.
- **Covid-19**: The Covid-19 Data includes epidemiological information and demographic data to predict Covid-19 infections.
- **Diabetes**: The Diabetes Dataset contains clinical measurements and patient information such as blood glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin levels to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- **Lung Cancer**: The Lung Cancer Data includes demographic information, medical history, and diagnostic imaging features to predict the presence and progression of lung cancer.
- **Anemia**: The Anemia Dataset provides hematological parameters and demographic data to predict the occurrence and severity of anemia in individuals.

### Models and Techniques:
For each medical condition, we have employed various machine learning algorithms and techniques tailored to the specific characteristics of the data:

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques to ensure robustness and accuracy in predictions.

### Results and Evaluation:
The models have been evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation reports, confusion matrices, and visualizations are provided for each model to assess their effectiveness and reliability.

### Usage:
Users can clone the repository, preprocess the datasets, train the models using provided scripts, and make predictions on new data. Instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction are provided in the respective directories.
